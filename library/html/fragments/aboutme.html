    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div class="col left">
        <p class="intro">Greetings!  Here's a lil' something about me: I've been designing &amp; developing websites for quite some time (since back when it was called the World Wide Web). My goal is to create logical and intuitive websites that work and look great on any device used to access them. I love learning new technologies and languages that bolster the information on the web and help to create a smooth, pleasureable user experience.</p>
        
        <p>I hold a bachelor's degree in Literature from the University of California at Santa Barbara 
        and a master's degree in Poetry from Sarah Lawrence College. </p>

        <p>Despite this writerly background, I am well-versed in html(5), css(3), javascript, NodeJS, Backbone, AJAX, jQuery (and many other JS libraries), SEO, accesibility standards, semantic markup, mySQL, PHP, XSL, XML, SOAP, and shell scripting. I've worked with many CMSs such as Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress, and the Lenya platform. </p>

        <p>I often work with Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Bridge, and Flash. There is 
        a lot to know when it comes to the web and I don't presume to know it all; I do, however, 
        love taking on new learning opportunities, and do not hesitate to partner with trusted 
        professionals (<a href="http://www.loakleydesign.com/" title="Laura Oakley Design">Laura Oakley</a>, Kriz Lazarz, Emily Kagan) for certain tasks when the need arises.</p>

        <p>I have worked in the web departments of UCLA's Medical School, Sarah Lawrence 
        College, <a href="http://www.cuny.edu" title="CUNY">The City University of New York</a> and, currently, I am a senior Front-end Engineer at <a href="http://zeebox.com" title="Zeebox Website">Zeebox</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm always on the lookout for new projects and new opportunities, so if you are interested in creating a website, changing the one you have, or just want to chat about webstuff <a href="#contact-me" class="go-contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>

        <p>I also enjoy cooking, playing the guitar, horology, taking long walks in Lake Peekskill with 
        my wife, and fantasizing about owning a bulldog some day.</p>
